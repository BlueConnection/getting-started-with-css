/*
  Variables declared here - these are the colors for my pages as well as the font stacks and sizes.

  We specify these variables in :root instead of html for several reasons:

  1) There is a before and after associated with html and by using :root,
     we don't have to worry about them as :root covers the entire DOM.

  2) Specificity - a pseudo class is more heavily weighted than a simple element like html.

  Note: targeting * is even worse than targeting html as * is easily overriden as it has 0 specificity.
